Hi, My name is Enrique P. Sobrepe√±a V

I am in my final year of college, GitHub may be new to me but those are the challenges of a Computer Science Major. Learning never stops.

I love listening to music and play video games. Currently my favorite artist is NewJeans which is a suprise because I've never been into KPOP. I am also currently watching the live action One Piece series and it is good, I might watch the anime. I have two favorite movies: Back to the Future and Whiplash. I also have the new TMNT movie and Barbie in my movie backlogs.
